    <p>
      My name is Caitlin and I am from Enfield, Connecticut. I moved to
      Hollywood, FL seven months ago and currently work at Total Wine<br> as a Wine
      Sales Associate! I have a degree in Performance Theatre from Western
      Connecticut State University, however I am looking<br> forward to furthering
      my education and starting a career in the tech field!<br />
      I wrote my first line of code in seventh grade on Myspace! I learned how
      to make text bold, italic and underlined, and learned how to<br> change the
      color of my profile. I also took CS100 at Western Connecticut State
      University where I built my own website! However, I<br> wanted to gain greater
      knowledge and actually become employable as a software engineer!
